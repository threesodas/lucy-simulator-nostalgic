# News about 1.4.0

### [Prodski](https://github.com/shakenbeet/), the original creator of Lucy Simulator, is working with me to bring you mod support for Lucy Simulator.
I have decided that 1.4.0 will be the final update of LSN. It will include mod support, so you never have to recreate the application.
<br />
Instructions to set up a mod will be included with the tools that you need.

## Update plans

- ADD a casino, allowing you to gamble to get more or less money. Could replace bank
- ADD Lucy types, with benefits.
- ADD 2 more endings
- ADD a surprise ;)
- ADD mod support: Mod menu for external mods created by other people.
- FIX code. I *may*, not guaranteed, rewrite the code for future mod development, as well as add comments to make mods easier.

These are only plans, some may not happen.
